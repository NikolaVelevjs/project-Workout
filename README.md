My project is about workouts, diets, and getting in shape. Here you can post workout programs and diet plans.
 
Workouts: 
	You can create a workout with exercises with images and videos about them. 
	And see which workouts are the best with the most likes.

Diets: 
	Here you can create a diet program with meals or snacks or what you want, you just need to measure and set the calories intake. 
	As well you can see which diets are the best with the most likes of all.

How to run the application :
	It is so easy you just need to install the package.json file, how to do it? Just open the terminal with "ctrl + ` " and write npm i. You do this for "poject" folder and "rest-api". Now you need to write in the terminal npm serve in the "project" and npm start in the "rest-api". It is done.

Now it is up to you how motivated you are to get in shape
